So a simple x gate on either qubit is sufficient to rotate a phi + into a psi +  and vice-versa. The same is true for rotating between phi - into psi -. Similarly the difference between phi + and phi - is simply the relative phase, which can be changed by a z on either qubit, and the same with psi + and psi -. So Alice could send her message by creating an entangled state first, and then changing it using x and z gates to encode the correct message.\n"
